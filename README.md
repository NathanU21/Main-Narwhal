<h3>An informational website about narwhals (Monodon monoceros)</h3>
<h1> What is a Narwhal?</h1>
  <p> Known as the unicorns of the grand blue sea, narwhals, also scientifically known as monodon monoceros, who are related towards poiposes, are commonly found in the Arctic Ocean and are indistinguishable with their large, horn-like teeth, which are found within male narwhals. And, much like whales, require air to breathe, and often emerge to breathe through small cracks in the icey surface. </p>

<h2> All Possible Habitats of Narwhals</h2>
 <p> To start off, narwhals are commonly found in the Arctic waters of Greenland and Canada, due to the how low the temperatures drop in that area. Besides these two areas, narwhals can also be found near Russia and Norway, due to the same reasons they are found in Canada and Greenland. </p>

<h2> Locations Where Narwhals are Found</h2>
  <p>For sightseers, most can spot narwhals near the edge of icey terrains, as narwhals will often need to resurface towards the top of the waters to breathe. The main challenege towards seeing actual narwhals is that narwhals can go on for several hours without having to resurface and breathe, so spotting them will take some time and a great amount of patience. </p>

<h2> The Anatomy of the Tooth </h2>

    <p> To start off, the male narwhal, despite its appearances, actually have two large teeth that most would consider "tusks". One tooth would go on for several feet, which is the "tusk" that most people notice when they see narwhals, and another tooth that is significanly smaller, about only one foot actually. Within the larger tooth, the tooth is styled to have constant grooves that continue throughout it, and as a male narwhal continues to age, more layers to this tooth is added. To add on to this, the larger tooth actually has several millions of nerves throughout it, which is mainly used to sense the narwhal's surroundings, creating a new perception towards its environment for the narwhal. </p>
