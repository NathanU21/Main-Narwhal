<h1> What is a Narwhal?</h1>
  <p> Known as the unicorns of the grand blue sea, narwhals, who are related towards poiposes, are commonly found in the Arctic Ocean and       are indistinguishable with their large, horn-like teeth, which are found within male narwhals. And, much like whales, require air to breathe, and often emerge to breathe through small cracks in the icey surface. </p>
<h1> All Possible Habitats/Locations Narwhals are Found </h1>
